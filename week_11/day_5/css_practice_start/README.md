# CSS Practice

This lesson is intended to provide a startpoint for learning to put CSS into practice.

It provides a skeleton HTML file including a variety of elements that can be styled - lists, links, block level elements etc. A very basic CSS file and some placeholder images have also been set up.

## Using the project

This code is intended to be run using a web server of some kind. (It can be run without, but you'll get ugly file:// URLs and you'll need to change the reference to the stylesheet.) 

The simplest way to get it up and running is as follows:

- cd into the css_practice_startpoint directory
- Run the command "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000" without the quotes. This will get a very basic web server up and running.
- Go to http://localhost:8000 and start styling!
- ctrl-c to stop the server
